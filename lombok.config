# Optimize the interaction of lombok use with some code-coverage-Tools (sonar-cube)

#This setting prevents Lombok from navigating further up the directory structure to search for additional lombok.config files.
#Normally, Lombok would go through all lombok.config files from your project directory up to the root directory and apply settings from them.
#With stopBubbling = true, this process is stopped as soon as the current lombok.config file has been processed.
config.stopBubbling = true

#When this option is enabled, Lombok adds the @lombok.Generated annotation to the code generated by Lombok.
#This annotation serves to signal to other tools (such as code coverage tools) that the marked code has been automatically generated
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true
