/**
 * contains control classes for employee management within the Employee Service
 * application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is central to the application's business logic and data access layers for
 * employee-related operations. It includes the following key components:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>EmployeeEventPublisher:</b> Responsible for publishing various events related to
 * employee actions. This class plays a crucial role in the application's event-driven
 * architecture, facilitating asynchronous communication and decoupling between different
 * parts of the system.</li>
 * <li><b>EmployeeRepository:</b> An interface for data access operations on employees.
 * This repository abstracts the underlying data storage mechanism and provides a clean
 * API for querying, saving, updating, and deleting employee records.</li>
 * <li><b>EmployeeService:</b> The service class that contains the business logic for
 * managing employees. It interacts with
 * {@link de.stminko.employeeservice.employee.control.EmployeeRepository} for data
 * persistence and utilizes
 * {@link de.stminko.employeeservice.employee.control.EmployeeEventPublisher} for
 * broadcasting relevant events. The service ensures that business rules are adhered to
 * and that data integrity is maintained across operations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These components work together to provide robust and maintainable functionalities for
 * employee management, aligning with the principles of clean architecture and separation
 * of concerns.
 * </p>
