/**
 * Provides the boundary classes for employee management in the Employee Service
 * application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package contains the classes responsible for interfacing with the client side and
 * handling HTTP requests related to employee operations. The primary class included is:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>EmployeeController:</b> A REST controller class responsible for handling
 * requests for managing employees. This includes operations like creating new employees,
 * retrieving employee details by ID, listing all employees, updating employee
 * information, and deleting employees. It leverages
 * {@link de.stminko.employeeservice.employee.control.EmployeeService} for business logic
 * and data processing, ensuring a clean separation between the web layer and the service
 * layer.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are designed to provide a clear and concise interface for
 * the outside world, abstracting the internal workings of the application and exposing
 * necessary functionalities for client interaction.
 * </p>
