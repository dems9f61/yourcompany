/**
 * contains entity classes for department management in the Employee Service application.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package encapsulates the core data structures used for department operations,
 * providing a robust model for the department domain within the system. It includes:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Department:</b> The core entity representing a department. This class includes
 * fields and methods necessary for representing department-specific information, such as
 * department name, and other relevant attributes.</li>
 * <li><b>DepartmentRequest:</b> A Data Transfer Object (DTO) used for encapsulating the
 * data received in API requests when creating or updating departments. It includes
 * validation annotations to ensure data integrity.</li>
 * <li><b>DepartmentResponse:</b> A DTO used for structuring the data sent back to clients
 * in API responses. This class typically includes fields that represent the department
 * data after being processed or retrieved from the database.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * These classes are essential for managing the department data lifecycle within the
 * application, from receiving API requests to sending out responses, and interacting with
 * the database.
