/**
 * manages RESTful error handling configurations and exceptions in the Employee Service
 * runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is dedicated to handling errors that occur during RESTful interactions in
 * the Employee Service. 'RestErrorHandlingAutoConfiguration' sets up automatic
 * configuration for error handling, ensuring that appropriate responses are generated for
 * various error conditions. 'BadRequestException' and 'NotFoundException' are specific
 * exception classes that represent common HTTP error scenarios, such as invalid requests
 * or missing resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are crucial for providing a robust error handling mechanism
 * in the Employee Service's RESTful APIs. They ensure that errors are managed
 * consistently and informatively, enhancing the service’s reliability and usability.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Overall, the errorhandling.boundary package plays a key role in defining how the
 * Employee Service handles and responds to errors in its RESTful interfaces, contributing
 * significantly to the overall API experience.
 * </p>
