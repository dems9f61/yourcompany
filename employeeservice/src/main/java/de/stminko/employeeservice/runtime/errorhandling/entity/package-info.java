/**
 * centralizes entities related to error handling in the Employee Service runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package contains the 'ErrorInfo' class, a fundamental entity designed to
 * encapsulate and represent error details in a structured manner. This class includes
 * fields such as URL, HTTP method, status, and error messages, which are crucial for
 * diagnosing and understanding the errors that occur during the runtime operation of the
 * Employee Service. 'ErrorInfo' also includes a set of 'ConstraintViolationInfo',
 * allowing for detailed reporting of validation errors.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The structured representation provided by 'ErrorInfo' is instrumental for effective
 * error logging, monitoring, and client-side error handling. It ensures that all relevant
 * error details are captured in a consistent format, facilitating easier analysis and
 * resolution of issues.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Overall, the errorhandling.entity package plays a vital role in the robust error
 * management strategy of the Employee Service, enhancing the service's reliability and
 * maintainability by providing clear and comprehensive error information.
