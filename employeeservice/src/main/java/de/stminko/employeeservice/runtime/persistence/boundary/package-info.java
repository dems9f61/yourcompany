/**
 * handles core persistence functionalities in the Employee Service runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package provides the foundational classes for the persistence layer of the
 * Employee Service. 'AbstractEntity', as a generic class, serves as a base for all entity
 * models, facilitating common persistence operations and ID handling.
 * 'CustomRevisionEntity' is tailored for audit purposes, enabling effective tracking of
 * entity revisions. 'DatasourceProxyBeanPostProcessor', implementing BeanPostProcessor,
 * enhances and customizes the behavior of data source beans, contributing to more
 * efficient and secure database interactions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are integral to implementing a cohesive and efficient
 * persistence strategy. They ensure streamlined entity management, robust data auditing,
 * and optimized database interactions, which are crucial for the scalability and
 * reliability of the Employee Service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Overall, the persistence.boundary package forms a key component in the Employee Service
 * architecture, supporting advanced data management capabilities and ensuring the
 * integrity and consistency of the service's data layer.
 * </p>
