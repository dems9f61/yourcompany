/**
 * focuses on validation and constraint management in the Employee Service runtime.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package forms a crucial part of the validation framework of the Employee Service,
 * containing classes and annotations that define and implement custom validation logic.
 * 'NullOrNotBlankValidator', an implementation of ConstraintValidator, ensures that
 * fields are either null or contain non-blank values. The '@NullOrNotBlank' annotation
 * provides a declarative way to apply this validation. Additionally,
 * 'MessageSourceConfig' and 'MessageSourceHelper' are instrumental in managing validation
 * messages, allowing for customizable and localized feedback.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The components within this package are essential for enforcing business rules and data
 * integrity across the Employee Service. They enable the development of robust and
 * flexible validation mechanisms that can be easily integrated into various parts of the
 * service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Overall, the validation.constraints.boundary package plays a vital role in maintaining
 * data quality and ensuring that user inputs and interactions adhere to predefined
 * standards and expectations within the Employee Service runtime environment.
 * </p>
