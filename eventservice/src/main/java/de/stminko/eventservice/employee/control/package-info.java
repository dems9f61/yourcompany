 * store employee event data, playing a crucial role in the persistence layer of the event
 * service. - {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.control.EmployeeEventService}: A
 * service class that encapsulates the business logic associated with employee events.

 * layer, ensuring that business rules and logic are correctly applied to the data being
 * processed and passed along.
 * <p>
 * These components work together to manage the data and business processes related to
 * employee events, ensuring efficient and consistent handling of employee information
