/**
 * focuses on the entity layer. This package defines the core entities and data structures
 * used to represent employee-related data and events, ensuring a well-structured and
 * coherent data model.
 * <p>
 * This package includes several key classes: -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.Department}: Represents the department
 * entity with its unique attributes. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.Employee}: Defines the employee entity,
 * encapsulating employee-specific information. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.EmployeeEventResponse}: Describes the
 * structure for responses related to employee events. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.EmployeeMessage}: Outlines the format
 * for messages related to employee events. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.EventType}: Enumerates the different
 * types of events that can occur related to employees. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.JsonDateDeSerializer} and
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.JsonDateSerializer}: Provide custom
 * serialization and deserialization for date fields in JSON, ensuring correct format
 * handling. - {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.PersistentEmployeeEvent}:
 * Represents an employee event that is persisted in the data store. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.employee.entity.UsableDateFormat}: Defines a format for
 * dates that is used across different entities and services.
 * <p>
 * Collectively, these classes form the backbone of the employee module's data
 * representation, enabling the effective handling, storage, and transmission of
 * employee-related information within the event service. They provide a clear and
 * consistent framework for representing employee data, crucial for the integrity and
 * functionality of the employee module.
