/**
 * focuses on the pagination aspects within the event service's runtime layer. This
 * package is essential for handling the pagination of data in RESTful services, ensuring
 * efficient data retrieval and display in a scalable and user-friendly manner.
 * <p>
 * Included in this package are the classes: -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.runtime.pagination.boundary.PageDeserializer}: A class
 * designed to handle the deserialization of paginated data. It interprets the paginated
 * data format and converts it into a usable structure within the application,
 * facilitating seamless integration with the event service's data processing flow. -
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.runtime.pagination.boundary.PageModule}: This class acts
 * as a configuration module for pagination, setting up necessary components and rules for
 * handling paginated data within the application. It ensures that pagination is
 * consistently managed across different parts of the event service.
 * <p>
 * The combination of these classes in the package provides a comprehensive solution for
 * managing pagination in REST APIs, enhancing the functionality and user experience of
 * the event service by allowing efficient handling of large datasets.
