/**
 * Provides entities related to the configuration and management of SpringDoc within a
 * Spring application.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes essential for customizing and managing the SpringDoc
 * integration, which is a tool used for generating Swagger documentation for Spring Boot
 * RESTful services. The primary focus of this package is to offer a streamlined and
 * configurable way to integrate SpringDoc into Spring Boot applications, allowing
 * developers to easily document their REST APIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link de.stminko.eventservice.runtime.swagger.entity.CustomSpringDocProperties}
 * class, for example, is a central configuration entity that allows developers to define
 * and manage settings such as enabling/disabling SpringDoc, specifying packages, and
 * paths for API scanning. This enhances the flexibility and control over how SpringDoc
 * interacts with the application, ensuring that API documentation is both accurate and
 * relevant to the specific needs of the application.
 * </p>
