/**
 * Focused on providing a global error handling mechanism for the event service runtime.
 * It establishes a boundary layer that captures and processes unhandled exceptions,

 * <p>
 * The
 * {@link de.stminko.eventservice.runtime.errorhandling.boundary.GlobalExceptionMapper} is
 * instrumental in enhancing the robustness of the event service, ensuring that all
 * exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, thereby maintaining a consistent and
 * user-friendly error response strategy.
