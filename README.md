# PROJECT: Employee- & Event-Services

# Goal

The purpose of this project is the implementation of two microservices: ***employee-service*** and ***event-service***.

### *employee-service*

As its name suggests, this service is responsible for handling the employees of a company. The application must expose a
REST API. It should contain endpoints to:

1. Create a department
    1. Id (auto-increment)
    2. Name
2. Create an employee in an existing department
    1. Uuid (generated automatically)
    2. E-mail
    3. Full name (first and last name)
    4. Birthday (format yyyy-MM-dd)
    5. Employee's department
3. Get a specific employee by uuid (response in JSON Object format)
4. Update an employee
5. Delete an employee

**Restriction:** The email field is unique, i.e 2 employees cannot have the same email

Whenever an employee is created, updated or deleted, an event related to this action must be pushed in some message
broker (i.e, Kafka, RabbitMq, etc).
This event must be listened by the event-service.

### *event-service*

This service is responsible for listening the events generated by the employee-service and save them in its own
database.
The event-service must expose a REST API that contains just one endpoint to:

1. Get all events related to a specific employee in ascending order, i.e, oldest event must appear first. Response in
   JSON Array format.

### Additional tasks

* Use [Swagger](https://swagger.io) to expose the employee-service and event-service endpoints
* Run the message broker and databases chosen to store the employee's data and employee event's data
  in Docker containers (instead of in-memory database).

# Implementation

## Requirements

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and start the docker deamon
- Install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Import the project as a maven project

## The databases

The employee-service manages employee and department entities which are in relation with each other. Because of that, I
decided to go for a relational database and I chose [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
The event-service on the other hand manages only event entities, which are in relation with no entity. Thus I decided to
go for a document-oriented database and I picked [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## The message broker

Both the employee- and the event-services share messages over a queue provider
through [rabbitmq](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

## Running the databases and the message broker

To have the both the databases and the message broker running, a docker daemon must have been started.
Go to the project root folder and before doing anything else, be sure that your ports 15672, 5672, 5432 and 27017 have
not been allocated or map the exposed docker ports to others host ports in the in `docker-compose.yml`
located in the project root folder.
Then use the following command

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
``` 

It will run the commands in `docker-compose.yml`. This will download all needed images and get the related containers
running.
After starting the rabbitmq instance, check if the containers have effectively been well started by using the following
command

```sh
$ docker-compose ps
```

the expected state of each running container instance must be *Up*. Following containers must be running:

- a container running the postgreSQL-database by the name of *employee_service_postgredb*
- a container running the mongoDB-database by the name of *event_service_mongodb*
- a container running the rabbitmq-message-broker by the name of *rabbitmq*



**Note:** The rabbitmq and database credentials can be found and adjusted in the respectively `yml` file of each service.
To stop those containers just enter the command
```sh
$ docker compose stop
```
After stopping the containers, remove the created volumes by entering the command
```sh
$ docker compose rm -v
```

## Running The employee-service and the employee event-service

Since starting the employee event-service will create all needed queues and exchanges on the rabbitmq server, it might
appear more preferable to start the employee event-service first.

**Note:** Each service port can also be found and adjusted in the `yml` file of each service.
By default, the employee-service will be running at port 8081 and the employee event-service will be running at port 8083.

### The employee event-service

**Reminder:** Starting the employee event-service will get all needed queues and exchanges on the rabbitmq server
automatically created

- To start the employee event-service, switch to the `eventservice` directory and enter the command 
```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
- Once started, all employee events related endpoints can be triggered using <http://localhost:8083/api/v1/events/>
- The Swagger API can be inspected here <http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html>

### The employee-service

- To start the employee-service, switch to the `empoyeeservice` directory and enter the command 
```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
- Once started, all employee related endpoints can be reached using <http://localhost:8081/api/v1/employees/> and all
  department related endpoints can be triggered using <http://localhost:8081/api/v1/departments/>
- The Swagger API can be inspected here <http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html>

## Testing

Feel free to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or Swagger to test the APIs.
